        Our story started with a shared vision between two friends who combined
        their unique talents to transform ordinary outdoor spaces into
        extraordinary experiences. George brought architectural expertise, while
        Dimitur added the technical know-how and a hands-on approach. Together,
        they founded Green Company with the mission to redefine landscape design
        and construction.
